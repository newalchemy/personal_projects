# Welcome!

Welcome to my repository!  Here you will find several programming / machine learning projects of mine, including:

 - Implementing Penalized K-Means by Gradient Descent on reduced-dimension images
 - Diagnosing Psychiatric Illness with an LSTM, using a very similar method to one used in NLP Sentiment Analysis
 - Using XGBoost to predict forest fire size
 
If you have any suggestions or contributions, please feel free to message me.  I hope you enjoy looking at this repository.
